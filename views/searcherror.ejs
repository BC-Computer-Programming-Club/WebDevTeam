					Manchester City Football Club, commonly referred to as Manchester City, Man City or simply City, is an English football club based in Manchester that competes in the Premier League, the top division in the English football league system. It was founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), then Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, in the first season with the current name.[3] Since its inception, the club has won eight league titles, six FA Cups, eight League Cups, six FA Community Shields and one European Cup Winners' Cup.

					The club joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. The club had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. Following promotion to the top tier in 2001–02, they have remained in the Premier League since 2002–03.
